As there has been infomrmation worth keeping, there has been information worth stealing, and today's world provides the would-be intruder many opportunities from exposed ports, to misconfigured proxies, to outdated software versions, to human point of failure. To me this gets at a bigger point - with such exposure from all sides in the instutitions we placed the most faith: government failing at massive levels to maintain basic human privacy (OPM x2), banks failing themselves to maintain liquidity, not to mention failing to maintain customer security and privacy (x/x major banks suffered from breach of confidential and private information), major lenders responsible for underwriting the American dream (owning a home), credit agencies failing to maintian the private confidential information they use to track us. I could go further on how exposed our societal institutions have left us, but the point of this blurb was to communicate the need for information security, and that might go on to expose further mechanized aspects of the modern human condition.",

        "Ethics in AI - where do robots get to draw the lines. Human compassion is something that capitalism has drived to drive out of society, but now dominant capitalists have found ways to programatically enabale the planned obsolensence of major factions of society, and humanity at large. The question is largely - what will become of these leftover traunces, under-represented economic minorities but physical pluralities. In this top heavy maelstorm of malprudence and faltering agencies of balance, reckoning is on the horizon. Will the individualist, the lone hacker, reign supreme - or will conglomerates and titans of industry manipulate hivemind in a way to eliminate opposition.",
